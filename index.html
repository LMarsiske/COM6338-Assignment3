          <p>
            Alice in Chains (often abbreviated as AIC) is an American rock band
            from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1987 by guitarist and vocalist
            Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who later recruited bassist
            Mike Starr and lead vocalist Layne Staley. Starr was replaced by
            Mike Inez in 1993. William DuVall joined the band in 2006 as co-lead
            vocalist and rhythm guitarist, replacing Staley, who died in 2002.
            The band took its name from Staley's previous group, the glam metal
            band Alice N' Chains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often associated with grunge music, Alice in Chains' sound
            incorporates heavy metal elements. The band is known for its
            distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals
            between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and DuVall).
            Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic EP Sap,
            and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice
            in Chains a two-vocal band.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge
            movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as
            Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. They achieved success during
            the era with the albums Facelift (1990), Dirt (1992), Alice in
            Chains (1995), as well as the EP Jar of Flies (1994). Although never
            officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended
            inactivity from 1996 onward, due to Staley's substance abuse, which
            resulted in his death in 2002. The band regrouped in 2006, with
            DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time, and they have since
            released three more albums: Black Gives Way to Blue (2009), The
            Devil Put Dinosaurs Here (2013), and Rainier Fog (2018).
          </p>
          <p>
            Alice in Chains have sold over 30 million records worldwide, and
            over 14 million records in the US alone. The band has had 18 Top 10
            songs on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, 5 No. 1 hits, and
            received 11 Grammy Award nominations. The band was ranked number 34
            on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and was ranked as the
            15th greatest live band by Hit Parader. Since its formation, Alice
            in Chains has released six studio albums, three EPs, three live
            albums, four compilations, two DVDs, 43 music videos, and 32
            singles.

            <h3>Black Gives Way to Blue</h3>
            <p>
              Black Gives Way to Blue is the fourth studio album by the American
              rock band Alice in Chains, released on September 29, 2009, on the
              17th anniversary of the release of their second album, Dirt. It is
              their first record without original lead singer Layne Staley, who
              died in 2002, and their first album with new vocalist and rhythm
              guitarist William DuVall sharing vocal duties with lead
              guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell, who sings lead vocals on most
              of the songs. The span of nearly fourteen years between the
              self-titled album and Black Gives Way to Blue, marks the longest
              gap between studio albums in Alice in Chains' career. The album
              debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold by
              the RIAA on May 26, 2010, with shipments exceeding 500,000 copies

              Rainier, a volcano that overlooks the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan
